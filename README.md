# My javascript learning journey

ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨This is my learning process with javascript (js) ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨.

## Collision system

The collisions system is available [here](collisions/index.html).

It consists of many agents that can bounce over the canvas.

This system is the base for all the following implementations.

## Solar system

The solar system is available [here](solarSystem/index.html).

The system makes use of Newton's laws to simulate a solar system with orbiting planets.
The formulas used in this implementation are as follows:

1. Law of motion:
$$ F = m * a $$
2. Law of gravity:
$$ F_{G} = \fract{G (m_{1} m_{2})}{r^{2}} $$
