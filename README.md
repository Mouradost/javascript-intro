# Javascript learning journey

ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨This is my learning process with javascript (js) ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨.

## Collision system

The collisions system is available [here](collisions/index.html).

It consists of many agents that can bounce over the canvas.

This system is the base for all the following implementations.

## Solar system

The solar system is available [here](solarSystem/index.html).

The system uses Newton's laws to simulate a solar system with orbiting planets.

The formulas used in this implementation are as follows:

1. Law of motion:
$$ F = m * a $$
2. Law of gravity:
$$ F_{G} = \frac{G (m_{1} m_{2})}{r^{2}} $$

## Plotly live data

The Plotly example is available [here](charts/index.html).

It is randomly generated data that is plotted every 1s. The plot is dynamically formatted so that it moves with the new coming data.

## Python instead of JavaScript ?

The new PyScript is in its alpha stage. I'm just trying out what it looks like.

You can find my demo [here](pythonScript/index.html).

## Neural Network Real-time visualization using Tensorflow js

A visualization of the network learning process in real-time using p5 and Tensorflow.

You can find my demo [here](neuralNetwork/index.html).
